                        Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can

                  agents will assume the unhealthy node has been rebooted, and it is safe to recover affected workloads.
                  This is extremely important as starting replacement Pods while they are still running on the failed
                  node will likely lead to data corruption and violation of run-once semantics.
                  In an effort to prevent this, the operator ignores values lower than a minimum calculated from the
